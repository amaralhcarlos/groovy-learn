/* built-in types
* byte − This is used to represent a byte value. An example is 2.
* short − This is used to represent a short number. An example is 10.
* int − This is used to represent whole numbers. An example is 1234.
* long − This is used to represent a long number. An example is 10000090.
* float − This is used to represent 32-bit floating point numbers. An example is 12.34.
* double − This is used to represent 64-bit floating point numbers which are longer decimal number representations which may be required at times. An example is 12.3456565.
* char − This defines a single character literal. An example is ‘a’.
* Boolean − This represents a Boolean value which can either be true or false.
* String − These are text literals which are represented in the form of chain of characters. For example “Hello World”.
